# RememberWindowsState

> **Never lose your workspace again.** RememberWindowsState automatically saves your open windows and restores them after a restart, shutdown, or crash — silently running in the System Tray.

## Overview

RememberWindowsState is a lightweight Windows utility that periodically snapshots your open application windows (title, executable path, and position) and restores them on demand. It is designed to be completely unobtrusive — living in the System Tray with zero visible footprint while you work.

Whether you've experienced an unexpected shutdown, a Windows Update reboot, or simply want to pick up exactly where you left off, RememberWindowsState has you covered.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| ⏱ **Auto-Save Snapshots** | Automatically captures your open windows at configurable intervals (10 seconds → 30 minutes) |
| 🔄 **Smart Restore** | At startup, shows only windows that are not already open — no duplicates |
| 🚀 **Run at Windows Login** | Optional autostart via Windows Registry |
| 🖥 **System Tray Icon** | Runs silently in the background with a clean tray menu |
| 🚫 **Application Blacklist** | Exclude specific apps (by `.exe` name) from being tracked |
| 📜 **Snapshot History** | View the last saved snapshot directly from the tray |
| 🔒 **Single-Instance Guard** | Prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously |
| 💾 **Local Storage Only** | All data is stored exclusively on your local machine — no cloud, no telemetry |

---

## Installation

### Use Prebuilt Installer

The easiest way to get started is to download the prebuilt installer:

1. Download the latest installer (`RememberWindowsState-Setup.exe`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/mostafanazarzadeh/RememberWindowsState/releases) page.
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
3. The application will launch and run silently in your System Tray.

### Build from Source

#### Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit)
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Dependencies** (auto-installed via `pip`):

```
pywin32 >= 306
psutil  >= 5.9.0
pystray >= 0.19.5
Pillow  >= 10.0.0
```

> For building an installer from source, [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) is also required.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostafanazarzadeh/RememberWindowsState.git
   cd RememberWindowsState
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Build Installer (.exe)

Build a standalone Windows executable and Inno Setup installer with a single command:

```bash
build.bat
```

This will:
1. Run **PyInstaller** to package the app into a single `.exe`
2. Run **Inno Setup** to produce a `.exe` installer in `dist/`

> Make sure [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) is installed at its default location before running the build script.

## Usage

### System Tray Menu

Right-click the tray icon to access:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| 💾 **Save Now** | Immediately take a snapshot of all open windows |
| 🔄 **Restore Windows** | Show a list of previously saved windows to reopen |
| ⚙️ **Settings** | Open the settings panel |
| ❌ **Exit** | Quit the application |

### Restore Dialog

When RememberWindowsState launches manually (not via Windows startup), it automatically checks whether any previously saved windows are not currently open. If so, it presents a **Restore Dialog** where you can:

- Select individual windows to reopen
- Select all with one click
- Dismiss and continue without restoring

### Launch Modes

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `python main.py` | Manual launch — shows restore dialog if unclosed windows exist |
| `python main.py --startup` | Startup launch — skips restore dialog, tracks silently |

---

## Configuration

Open **Settings** from the tray icon to configure:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Save Interval** | 30 seconds | How often to snapshot open windows |
| **Run at Windows Startup** | Off | Add/remove from Windows Registry autostart |
| **Blacklist** | *(empty)* | List of `.exe` filenames to exclude from tracking |

Settings are persisted automatically to `config.json`.

---

## Data & Storage

All data is stored **locally on your machine** under:

```
%APPDATA%\RememberWindowsState\
├── config.json          ← Application settings
├── windows_state.json   ← Latest window snapshot
└── logs/
    └── app.log          ← Application log file (rotated at 200 KB)
```

**On Windows, this typically resolves to:**

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\RememberWindowsState\
```

The `windows_state.json` file stores:
- Window **title**
- Executable **path** (`exe`)
- Window **position and size** (`rect`)

No personal data, keystrokes, or screen content is ever captured.

```

1. **Track**: `window_tracker.py` uses the Win32 `EnumWindows` API (via `pywin32`) along with `psutil` to enumerate all visible, non-system windows.
2. **Snapshot**: Each window's title, executable path, and screen coordinates are serialised to `windows_state.json`.
3. **Schedule**: `scheduler.py` calls the snapshot function on a configurable timer in a background daemon thread.
4. **Restore**: On next launch, `window_restorer.py` compares the snapshot against currently running processes and offers to relaunch any that are missing.

### Reporting Bugs

Please open a GitHub Issue if you run into any problems, such as:

- Any internal background helper windows (such as `OfficePowerManagerWindow` or other hidden system components) mistakenly showing up in your tracked window list or restore dialogs.

When reporting bugs, **please attach/include your log file**. You can find it at:
`%APPDATA%\RememberWindowsState\logs\app.log`
*(Typically: `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\RememberWindowsState\logs\app.log`)*

When reporting, please include:
- Your Windows version
- Python version
- Steps to reproduce
- The name, title, or class of any background window that shouldn't have been tracked (if applicable)
- The name/executable path of any application that failed to restore (if applicable)
- Any error messages from the console or log files
